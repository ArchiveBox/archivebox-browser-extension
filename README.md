# ðŸ—ƒ ArchiveBox Browser Extension

This is a browser extension (works in Chrome, Firefox, and Chrome-like browsers) that lets you automatically send pages from domains you specify to your ArchiveBox instance. This has a couple of benefits:

- You have a fulltext search of your browsing history ready at your fingertips
- Prevent link rot for important information!
- Access important information even if you're offline

## Download

- [Chrome/Edge/Other Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/habonpimjphpdnmcfkaockjnffodikoj)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/archivebox-exporter/)

## Setup

1. Set up an [ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox#quickstart) server and make sure it's accessible to the machine you're browsing on
2. Configure your ArchiveBox server to allow URL submissions without requiring login ([more info here...](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration#public_index--public_snapshots--public_add_view))
    ```bash
    archivebox config --set PUBLIC_ADD_VIEW=True
    # (make sure to restart the server after to apply this change)
    ```

3. Configure the extension to point to your ArchiveBox server's base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`, `https://archivebox.example.com`, etc.)

## Features

- Different archive modes
  - Allowlist mode doesn't archive pages by default, and lets you specify domains or regexes to archive
  - Blocklist mode archives all visited pages by default, but lets you specify domains or regexes to not archive
- Archive any arbitrary page with the "Archive Current Page" context menu item
- Archive any link with the "Archive Link" context menu item

## Development

If you wish to contribute to (or just build for yourself) this extension, you will need to download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once that's installed, navigate to this project's root and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

To build a production version (minified, optimized, etc.), run `npm run build`.

If you plan on making changes often, you can use the command `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild the extension as you modify files.

Both commands will produce an output in the `dist` directory.
