# ðŸ—ƒ ArchiveBox Browser Extension

This is a browser extension that lets you send individual browser tabs or all URLs matching certain patterns to your [ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox) instance for offline preservation. This has a couple of benefits:

- Own your data: save the web content that matters to you most, protect against link rot
- Protect your data: save offline copies of pages in common, durable formats that will last for generations
- Use your data: collect and tag important bookmarks, full-text search through your browsing history, automatically push captured data into other systems using ArchiveBox's APIs

## Setup

1. Set up an [ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox#quickstart) server and make sure it's accessible to the machine you're browsing on
2. Configure your ArchiveBox server to allow URL submissions without requiring login ([more info here...](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration#public_index--public_snapshots--public_add_view))  
    *Alternatively: if you stay signed in to your ArchiveBox instance in the same browser, it will share your login credentials.*
    ```bash
    archivebox config --set PUBLIC_ADD_VIEW=True
    # (make sure to restart the server after if you apply this change)
    ```

4. Configure the extension to point to your ArchiveBox server's base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`, `https://archivebox.example.com`, etc.)  
    <img width="400" alt="Screenshot of extension config area: example with localhost" src="https://github.com/ArchiveBox/archivebox-extension/assets/511499/43673b8c-389d-45f7-9cda-f1ec72844a00" align="top"><img width="350" alt="Screenshot of extension config area: example with demo" src="https://github.com/ArchiveBox/archivebox-extension/assets/511499/82d6ae08-6327-45ef-a536-cb775ec58b41" align="top">

## Development

*âœ¨ Originally contributed by [TJ Horner (@tjhorner)](https://github.com/tjhorner), now maintained by [@benmuth](https://github.com/benmuth) and the [ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox) team.*

If you wish to contribute to (or just build for yourself) this extension, you will need to download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArchiveBox/archivebox-browser-extension
cd archivebox-browser-extension/

npm install
npm run build

# or for hot-reloading during development:
npm run dev
```

Both commands will produce an output in the `dist/` directory, load that folder into Chrome or Firefox using their [Load Unpacked Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) UI.

Please open an issue to discuss any proposed changes *before* starting work on any PRs.

- [Memex](https://memex.garden/) (another project focused on annotating that supports archiving)
